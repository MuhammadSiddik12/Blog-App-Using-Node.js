Created a simple blog app. User can sing-up and login and then post any post and also like or dislike the post

In this project, I have made a backend of a blog-app website using Express framework of NodeJS. I have also used JWT-authentication token to verify the if the user is valid or not.

## Task Details:
Lets make a simple blog app with only the home page functional. a user should be able to:

    -Register using email & password ( use JWT for authentication )
    -Login
    -Create a post
    -See all posts from other users on home page ( sorted from most recent )
    -Like/Dislike a post
    -see how many likes/dislikes a post
    
### In this project I have used MongoDb, jsonwebtoken, Express, Nodemon, Mongoose, Bycrpt and many more.
